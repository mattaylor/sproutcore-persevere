The goal is to be a sproutcore framework that makes it really easy to use persevere with SproutCore.

If I can find a good example I'd like to remove all the directory hierarchy so you don't have to go into
sproutcore-persevere/frameworks/persevere to get to the actual framework.

You can run the tests by:

1. in one terminal cd to the testserver directory and run "persvr --base-uri /testserver"
2. in another terminal run "sc-server" in the root of the project.
3. open a browser to http://localhost:4020/persevere/en/current/tests/data_sources.html

NOTE: You'll need to install persevere to run the command above.
